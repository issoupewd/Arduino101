# Turning Servo by Potentiometer

This project illustrates how to control a servo motor using a potentiometer, employing two distinct methods:

## Method 1: Using If Statement with All Positions
- using an `if` statement to control the servo's positions from 0 to 180 degrees based on the potentiometer's input.

## Method 2: Using Switch Case with 3 Positions
- using `switch case` statement to control the servo's positions with three distinct angles based on the potentiometer's input.
