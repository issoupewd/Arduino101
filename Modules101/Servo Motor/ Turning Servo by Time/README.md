# Turning Servo by Time

This project demonstrates how to rotate a servo from 0 to 180 degrees and back to 0 degrees and we will explore two examples.:

## Method 1: Using Two For Loops
- using two `for` loops to control the servo's movement. The first loop moves it from 0 to 180 degrees, and the second loop returns it from 180 back to 0 degrees.

## Method 2: Using if condition with `millis()`
- This method introduces an `if` statement combined with the `millis()` function, which is a built-in timer in Arduino.
