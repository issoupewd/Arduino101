# Changing Servo Positions with Buttons

In this project, the goal is to provide the servo with four fixed positions using four buttons, each corresponding to a specific angle: 0, 45, 90, and 180 degrees.

## Method 1: Using a Bunch of If Statements
- Using multiple `if` statements to control the servo's positions based on button inputs.

## Method 2: Using For Loop, One If Statement, and Switch Case Statements
- Using a combination of a `for` loop, an `if` statement, and `switch case` statements to control the servo's positions based on button inputs.
