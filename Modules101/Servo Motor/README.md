# Servomotor:
A servo motor is an electromechanical device that is used to precisely control the position, speed, and
acceleration of an object, a servo motor consists of four main components:
- **DC Motor:** The servo motor contains a high-speed, low-torque
DC motor.
- **Control Circuit:** The control circuit is responsible for
controlling the motor, setting the angle of rotation.
- **Gears:** Gears are used to transform the high-speed rotation of
the DC motor into slower but higher-torque rotation.
- **Potentiometer:** produces a voltage that corresponds to the
absolute angle of the output shaft. This voltage is used by the
control circuit to determine the servo's position.

# Projects
In this section, you will learn the following:

**- Servo Control:** Basics of servo motor , turning the servo to a specific angle.

**- Servo Control by an Input:** Controlling the servo using an input from the PC through the serial monitor.

**- Turning Servo by Time:** Making the servo rotate from 0 to 180 degrees and back to 0 degrees.

**- Turning Servo by Potentiometer:** Controlling the servo using a potentiometer.
