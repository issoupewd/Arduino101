# Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04:
An ultrasonic sensor operates by emitting sound waves at a frequency beyond the human hearing range, typically around 40 kHz. This emitted sound wave travels through the air, and upon encountering an obstacle or object, it reflects or bounces back to the sensor. The ultrasonic sensor consists of two primary components:

- **Transmitter (Trig):** This component emits the sound wave using piezoelectric crystals, which generate sound when subjected to an electrical current, initiating the initial wave.
  
- **Receiver (Echo):** Once the sound wave travels to the target and reflects back, the receiver component detects this bounced-back sound wave.

# Projects
In this section, you will learn the following:

**- Distance Measurement on PC:** using the sensor's capabilities to measure distances accurately and displaying them on a pc with serial monitor.

**- Alarm System:** Implementing the sensor to trigger a buzzer when an object is detected within a specified range.

**- Opening a Door When an Object is Detected:** using the sensor's ability to detect objects to trigger a mechanism that opens a door (servo).

**- SONAR:** using ultrasonic waves to identify and locate objects within a designated area or space.
