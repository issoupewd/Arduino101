# Leds 101

Getting started with Arduino, you will learn the basics by working with LEDs. From blinking a single LED to controlling multiple LEDs, changing the LED state based on button or potentiometer input, and understanding the fundamental functions that will be applied in more complex modules and projects

# projects
In this section, you will learn the following:

**- Hello World:** Basic LED blinking.
   
**- Traffic Light Control by Time:** Simulating traffic lights with time-based control for both pedestrians and cars.

**- Turns On LEDs with Buttons:** Using buttons to control LED states.

**- Traffic Light Control by Buttons:** Using buttons to control traffic lights, granting pedestrians the ability to stop cars.

**- LED Brightness Control by Code:** Gradually increasing and decreasing LED brightness programmatically.

**- LED Brightness Control by Potentiometer:** Controlling LED brightness using a potentiometer.



These projects are fundamental in Arduino development and will serve as building blocks for more complex and interesting projects in the future.
