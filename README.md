# Arduino101  

This course was originally created in 2023 to help two of my classmates learn Arduino. Later, in December 2024, a revised version with nearly the same structure featuring more precision and some new topics was presented as an online workshop series on the [@CELEC](https://github.com/celec-club) Discord server.
